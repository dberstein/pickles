Installation Guide
------------------

1. Extract PICKLES source code to the location of your choice. I usually
   put it in /usr/share/pickles

2. Add PICKLES to your include path. This can be accomplished a number of
   ways, my preference being adding it to the VirtualHost entry of my
   Apache config and restart Apache:

		php_value include_path .:/usr/share/pickles

3. Peep the sample-site directory, this contains a working site that should be
   fairly easy to get up and running.

4. If all else fails, get in touch!
